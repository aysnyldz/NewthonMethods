# Newton-Type Methods Algorithm Project

In this project we studied on newton type methods which is the most famous approach for solving nonlinear equations and minimizing functions. This project gives a short introduction to newton type methods with a brief a discussion of some of the main issues in applying this algorithm for the solution of the practical problems. We compare three types of methods which use this approach:

* Newton Raphson
* 1-D Unconstraint Optimization
* Multidimensional Unconstraint Optimization (Newton and Quasi-Newton)
